# Data Processing Functions

The data processing functions in this directory are used to preprocess and filter sensor data before it is used by the mapping and collision avoidance algorithms.

## Kalman Filter

The Kalman filter is a data processing function that uses a probabilistic model to estimate the state of a system based on noisy sensor data. The algorithm uses a combination of a prediction step and a correction step to estimate the state of the system.

### Key Features

- Can handle noisy sensor data
- Can estimate the state of a system over time
- Can be used for localization and mapping

## Extended Kalman Filter

The extended Kalman filter is an extension of the Kalman filter that can handle nonlinear systems. The algorithm uses a linear approximation of the nonlinear system to estimate the state of the system.

### Key Features

- Can handle nonlinear systems
- Can estimate the state of a system over time
- Can be used for localization and mapping
