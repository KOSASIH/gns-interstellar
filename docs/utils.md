# Utility Functions

The utility functions in this directory are used by the mapping and collision avoidance algorithms to perform various tasks, such as data conversion, transformation, and visualization.

## Data Conversion

The data conversion functions are used to convert sensor data into a format that can be used by the mapping and collision avoidance algorithms.

### Key Features

- Can convert data from different sensors into a common format
- Can handle different data types and structures
- Can be used to preprocess sensor data
- 
## Data Transformation

The data transformation functions are used to transform sensor data into a different coordinate frame.

### Key Features

- Can transform data from one coordinate frame to another
- Can handle different coordinate frames and transformations
- Can be used to align sensor data with the map

## Data Visualization

The data visualization functions are used to visualize the sensor data and the maps built by the mapping and collision avoidance algorithms.

### Key Features

- Can visualize data in 2D and 3D
- Can handle different data types and structures
- Can be used to debug and analyze the performance of the algorithms#
