# Positioning Algorithms

The positioning algorithms are responsible for determining the current position and orientation of the robot in the environment. This is typically done using sensors such as GPS, accelerometers, and gyroscopes. In this section, we will provide detailed documentation for the positioning algorithms used in our project.

## Overview

The positioning algorithms in our project use a combination of sensor data and map information to determine the current position and orientation of the robot. The algorithms are designed to be robust to noise and errors in the sensor data, and to provide accurate and reliable positioning in a variety of environments.

## Implementation

The positioning algorithms are implemented in the `positioning.py` module, which contains the following classes and functions:

### Position

The `Position` class represents a position and orientation in the environment. It contains the following attributes:

- `x`: The x-coordinate of the position.
- `y`: The y-coordinate of the position.
- `theta`: The orientation of the position, represented as an angle in radians.

The `Position` class also provides the following methods:

- `from_sensor_data(sensor_data)`: Creates a new `Position` object from sensor data.
- `to_tuple()`: Converts the `Position` object to a tuple of `(x, y, theta)` values.

### PositioningAlgorithm

The `PositioningAlgorithm` abstract base class defines the interface for positioning algorithms. It contains the following methods:

- `update(sensor_data)`: Updates the current position and orientation based on the given sensor data.
- `get_position()`: Returns the current position and orientation as a `Position` object.

### ParticleFilter

The `ParticleFilter` class implements a particle filter positioning algorithm. It uses a set of particles to represent the posterior distribution over possible positions and orientations, and updates the particles based on the sensor data and motion model. The `ParticleFilter` class provides the following methods:

- `resample()`: Resamples the particles based on their weights.
- `predict(motion_model)`: Predictsthe new positions and orientations of the particles based on the given motion model.
- `update(sensor_data)`: Updates the weights of the particles based on the given sensor data.

### KalmanFilter

The `KalmanFilter` class implements a Kalman filter positioning algorithm. It uses a state-space model to estimate the current position and orientation based on the sensor data and motion model. The `KalmanFilter` class provides the following methods:

- `predict()`: Predicts the new state based on the given motion model.
- `update(sensor_data)`: Updates the state based on the given sensor data.

## Usage

To use the positioning algorithms in your code, you can import the `Position` class and the desired positioning algorithm class from the `positioning` module. Here is an example of how to use the `ParticleFilter` class:

```python
from positioning import Position, ParticleFilter

# Create a new ParticleFilter object
pf = ParticleFilter()

# Update the position and orientation basedon sensor data
pf.update(sensor_data)

# Get the current position and orientation as a Position object
position = pf.get_position()

# Convert the Position object to a tuple of (x, y, theta) values
x, y, theta = position.to_tuple()
