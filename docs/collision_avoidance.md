# Collision Avoidance Algorithms

The collision avoidance algorithms in this directory are designed to prevent robots and other autonomous systems from colliding with obstacles in the environment.

## DynamicWindow Approach

The dynamic window approach is a collision avoidance algorithm that uses a dynamic window to search for safe trajectories in real-time. The algorithm considers the motion constraints of the robot and the obstacles in the environment to find a safe trajectory.

### Key Features

- Real-time collision avoidance
- Can handle dynamic obstacles
- Can be used for high-speed motion

## Artificial Potential Fields

The artificial potential field algorithm is a collision avoidance algorithm that uses a potential field to attract the robot to its goal and repel it from obstacles. The algorithm calculates the force acting on the robot at each point in time and uses this force to move the robot towards its goal.

### Key Features

- Simple and efficient
- Can handle static obstacles
- Can be used for low-speed motion
