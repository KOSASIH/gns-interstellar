# Design

The spacecraft subsystems' code project is designed as a collection of modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of spacecraft functionality. The main modules are:

- thermal_management: Functions for managing the spacecraft's thermal systems.
- fault_detection_and_recovery: Functions for detecting and recovering from faults in the spacecraft's subsystems.
- positioning: Algorithms for determining the spacecraft's position.
- mapping: Algorithms for mapping the spacecraft's environment.
- collision_avoidance: Algorithms for avoiding collisions with obstacles.
- data_processing: Functions for processing and analyzing data.
- utils: Utility functions and classes.

The project is designed to be modular, with each module being responsible for a specific aspect of spacecraft functionality. This allows for easy testing and maintenance of the code.

The thermal_management module is responsible for managing the spacecraft's thermal systems. This includes functions for monitoring the spacecraft's temperature and adjusting the spacecraft's systems to maintain a safe temperature.

The fault_detection_and_recovery module is responsible for detecting and recovering from faults in the spacecraft's subsystems. This includes functions for monitoring system health, diagnosing faults, and executing recovery procedures.

The positioning module is responsible for determining the spacecraft's position. This includes algorithms for calculating the spacecraft's position based on sensor readings.

The mapping module is responsible for mapping the spacecraft's environment. This includes algorithms for creating a map of the spacecraft's environment based on sensor readings.

The collision_avoidance module is responsible for avoiding collisions with obstacles. This includes algorithms for detecting obstacles and adjusting the spacecraft's course to avoid them.

The data_processing module is responsible for processing and analyzing data. This includes functions for cleaning and transforming data, as well as functions for analyzing data and extracting insights.

The utils module is responsible for providing utility functions and classes that are used throughout the project. This includes functions for working with vectors, matrices, and other mathematical constructs.

The project also includes a tests directory, which contains unit tests and integration tests for the various modules. This allows for easy testing and validation of the code.

The project is designed to be scalable and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new features and functionality. The modular design allows for easy integration with other systems and subsystems.

The project is also designed to be robust and fault-tolerant, with functions for detecting and recovering from faults in the spacecraft's subsystems. This ensures that the spacecraft can continue to operate safely and efficiently, even in the event of a fault or failure.

In summary, the spacecraft subsystems' code project is a well-designed and well-organized collection of modules that are responsible for managing the spacecraft's thermal systems, detecting and recovering from faults, determining the spacecraft's position, mapping the spacecraft's environment, avoiding collisions with obstacles, processing and analyzing data, and providing utility functions and classes. The project is designed to be modular, scalable, extensible, robust, and fault-tolerant, ensuring that the spacecraft can operate safely and efficiently in a variety of environments and conditions.
